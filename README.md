Press the button and generate a random color. Toggle between choosing a hex color or a basic color.
Instructor-led project building from https://johnsmilga.com/. Added some of my own CSS elements, specific customizations, and transitions to make it a more smooth experience for the user. Also updated the JavaScript to use basic colors in the 'simple' tab.
